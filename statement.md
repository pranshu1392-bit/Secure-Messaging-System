# Project Statement

## 1. Problem Statement
In an age of digital surveillance, sending plain text messages poses a privacy risk. Users need a simple, offline tool to scramble (encrypt) and unscramble (decrypt) sensitive text to ensure confidentiality during data transmission or storage.

## 2. Scope of the Project
This project is a text-based CLI (Command Line Interface) application that allows users to:
* Encrypt plain text using a custom word-shifting algorithm.
* Decrypt cipher text back to a readable format.
* Validate user inputs to prevent errors.
It is designed for local usage and educational demonstration of Python logic.

## 3. Target Users
* Students learning cryptography and Python logic.
* General users needing a quick tool to obfuscate text for privacy.

## 4. High-Level Features
* **Encryption Engine:** Converts readable words into scrambled strings using randomization.
* **Decryption Engine:** Reverses the scrambling process to retrieve original data.
* **Input Guard:** Ensures invalid options or empty messages do not crash the program.
